            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Besides this FAQ section, we invite you to read our T&Cs and groups guidelines. They exist to make sure that we start a relationship of mutual understanding and to make sure that Nucapacha is a safe, happy and welcoming place to stay. By confirming a reservation at Hostel Nucapacha, regardless if this sheet is signed, you are agreeing to all important points described.</p>

                <b>Where is the hostel located? Is it close to the city center?</b>
                <p>We are located in Urdesa Central, this is 15 to 20 minutes away from what is known as the city center. Due to the exorbitant growing of Guayaquil, Urdesa is the geographical center of the city and what you may know as the ‘centro’ would actually be the geographical east. Urdesa is a beautiful upscale neighborhood that lies on the estuary side, in spite of the commercial activity on the main streets, the mayor has successfully achieved that the side streets remain a residential area.
                    We are two blocks away from the main avenue Victor Emilio Estrada, where you can find many banks, restaurants, retail stores, bars, and office buildings.</p>

                <b>How do I get from the bus terminal/airport to the hostel</b>
                <p>Public transportation in Ecuador can be a little bit messy and although we are sure after a few days you’ll become an expert, we highly recommend that for getting here you take a taxi. It’s easier and safer is you are with all your bags. Check out the hostel <a href="#location">location</a> pages for directions.</p>


                <b>Are you close to public transportation?</b>
                <p>We are only 2 blocks away from one of the main avenues in the city were you can get access to a lot of buses that will drive you pretty much everywhere in the city.</p>

                <b>Can children under 18 years old, stay at the hostel?</b>
                <p>Children under 18 must be booked in private rooms and always accompanied with adults.</p>

                <b>How do I cancel or amend my reservation?</b>
                <p>If you’ve booked directly with us, you can cancel up to 24 hours before arrival without charge. See our Terms & Conditions for more information.</p>

                <b>Do you accept credit cards?</b>
                <p>Credit cards are accepted through TAB app, which charges a 4% fee. The advantages of this app is that you won’t have to pay foreign card usage fees to your bank and it uses pure exchange rates with no hidden commission.</p>

                <b>How do I make a group booking?</b>
                <p>If there’s 15 or more of you who’d like to book to stay with us, please get in touch with us trough contact@nucapacha.com to handle it directly. Please note that we are not a party hostel.</p>

                <p>We do our very best to make sure you and your friends are all placed in the same room. However it also depends on our availability. If you wish to have a room for you and your friends we always recommend to book a private room instead of beds in the dorm.</p>
                <b>What’s the difference between a twin room and a double room?</b>
                <p>A twin room is a room that has one bunk bed and a double room is a room that has one double bed.</p>

If you arrive before 2:00pm, feel free to leave your bag in the free luggage room and get out and explore the city! If you’re leaving any valuables, make sure to rent a secure locker.  Please keep in mind that, as a hostel, our rooms are rented by the night rather than the day, so 5:00am is still considered to be the previous night and you’ll be charge full price. If you are planing on arriving before 7am we recommend you to book the night before.
                    You’ll need to be packed up and out of your room by 12pm on the day that you’re leaving. Please drop your key back at Reception – other guests can use it after you!</p>
                <b>Do you provide bed linen and towels?</b>

                <p>You’re welcome to smoke/vape in outside areas of the hostel. we have plenty, just make sure you don’t do throw cigarette butts in the flowerbeds; plants hate that. Also, would it be too much to ask you not to smoke when there are kids near you?</p>
                <b>What's for breakfast?</b>
                <p>As a thank you for staying with us, a complimentary breakfast including toast, eggs, natural juice and fresh brew coffee is served from 7:30 to 10:00 am.</p>
